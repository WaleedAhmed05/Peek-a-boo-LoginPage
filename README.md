Peek-A-Boo login window is simple but creative login page. Design inspired from **Darin Senneff.**
All Avatar design & UI work done in collaboration with @Muhamad Saqib Ali, UI/UX designer.

**How it works?**

When you start typing your email address/username the avatar watches your keystrokes with his eyes, and when you type password it will cover his eyes. Moreover, if you enter wrong email or password, you will see confuse face otherwise it will watch you with happy face.
